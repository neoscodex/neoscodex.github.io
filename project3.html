										<h3>What is I CAN'T C# ?</h3>
										<p>I CAN’T C# is a challenging game designed to enhance players concentration through a series of 18 mini-games. Players have the option to play each mini-game individually or engage in the main mode where two games are played simultaneously. This dual-task mode encourages players to maintain focus to avoid a sudden game over. The primary goal is to achieve high scores and demonstrate enduring concentration skills. Challenge yourself to continuously improve and establish your prowess in concentration.</p>
										<p>This group project was developed as part of the <a href="https://showtime.f4.htw-berlin.de/ss23/bachelor/b2-i-cant-c-sharp/">bachelor's project in the summer of 23</a>, focusing on the topic "Konzentrationsförderung durch Minigames" (Enhancing concentration through minigames). The team consisted of seven members, including myself and six highly skilled colleagues, Enno Kleinfeldt, Jannis Suchanek, Jerome Delafosse, Milana Tran, Nermin Rustic and Pascal Radtke. Spanning five months, we collaborated closely to bring this project to fruition.</p>
										<p>I CAN'T C# is currently available for free at <a href="https://n-c0de-r.itch.io/i-cant-c-sharp">itch.io</a></p>
										<h3>Project Overview</h3>
										<p>The project was developed using the Unity Engine. As it was our first experience with C# programming, and inspired by the playful idea that players might have blurred vision while concentrating on challenging gameplay, we humorously named our project "I CAN’T C#". The development process was divided into several stages: first, we spent time defining a cohesive vision for the project; next, we focused on refining core mechanics and features; finally, we began programming while continually refining our vision to enhance the player experience. Each team member was assigned different core objectives. While some focused on creating the game's framework, others designed and developed the various mini-games and necessary assets. Collaboration was key, with team members frequently assisting each other when tasks proved challenging or time-consuming. My responsibilities included, but were not limited to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designing the overall gameplay experience</li>
											<li>Designing and implementing various mini-games</li>
											<li>Creating and implementing sound effects</li>
											<li>Conducting playtesting and bug-fixes</li>
											<li>Assisting and supporting team members as needed</li>
										</ul>
