										<h3>What is Starmellow?</h3>
										<p>Starmellow is a 2D jump and run platformer game. You play as a Marshmellow who was abandoned by a lone camper and got lost in the woods. But on this fateful day you witness a star shower. Invigorated by the glittering sight you decide to give chase and make your way to find the twinkling stars, giving them a new home. But be careful, danger awaits in the woods.</p>
										<p>The game boasts a range of engaging features, including custom-made animations and UI visuals that enhance the player experience. Players can enjoy smooth 2D movement with a dash mechanic and encounter different enemy types throughout their journey. Health and star collectibles are available, with the latter powering a stargauge for a powerful dash attack.</p>
										<h3>Project Overview</h3>
										<p>The game "Starmellow" was developed using the Unity Engine, where I built it from scratch, implementing and refining features to enhance my original vision. I created approximately 50% of the game’s assets, including UI elements and character animations, while the remaining assets, such as tilemaps and sounds, were sourced from publicly available resources. My responsibilities included, but were not limited to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designing and implementing all game features</li>
											<li>Writing and optimizing game scripts</li>
											<li>Integrating sounds, animations, and UI elements</li>
											<li>Developing menus and settings</li>
											<li>Creating custom animations and other assets</li>
											<li>Implementing enemy AI</li>
											<li>Designing and constructing levels</li>
										</ul>
